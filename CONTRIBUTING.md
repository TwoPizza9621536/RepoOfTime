Next up is more expectations for contributing.

### Commit Signing

Commits are needed to be signed by your gpg key so there are no arguments about who commited it
and have the commit verified. Make sure the correct key is used sign the commit.
Signing commit wil be addressed later.

### Commits

All commits should be filed with a pull request
and each pull request can only change ONE project and files that are related to that project.
If you change multiple projects then have each projects have it's own pull request.

### Adding Projects

If you add a project fork the repo and checkout a branch with `yourusername-main` and replace yourusername with your
github username so branch rules are applied. Then request a pull request for the project to be approved.
Porting a project from one language to another are fine. If this is your first time then checkout a
branch `first-timers-yourusername` and replace yourusername with your
github username so branch rules are applied.

### Criticism

There will bre criticism and this is not a place to argue who code. This is a place
where people can find solutions quickly and improve your coding. So there will be
criticism.
